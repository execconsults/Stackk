        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-black mb-2 userline">Digital Product Refund Policy</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">As STAKK offers digital educational products and services, including but not limited to online courses, webinars, and downloadable content, we operate under a no-refund policy for all digital product purchases. Due to the nature of digital information being irrevocably received and impossible to return, all sales are final once access to the course materials has been granted.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">However, we understand that exceptional circumstances may occur. Therefore, we offer limited refund scenarios:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li class="text-gray-700"><span class="font-bold">Technical Issues</span>: If you are unable to access the purchased course due to technical issues from our end and we are unable to resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe, you may be eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li class="text-gray-700"><span class="font-bold">Course Cancellation</span>: If STAKK cancels a course for any reason, registrants will receive a full refund within 30 days of the cancellation announcement.</li>
        </ul>
